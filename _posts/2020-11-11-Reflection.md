what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do
- This course makes me believe there are more things a data scirentis can do than before.  Buidling models and make statistical inference is just part of data scientists's job. Data scientits can also do coding to publish their product online.

what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
- yes, of course. R is so feasible and has a lot of functions that can used at my work.

what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
- I will use ggplot more often to make the plot more beautiful. Also, shiny packages provide a really good way to communite with clienet or someone who is not with a statisitc background.
