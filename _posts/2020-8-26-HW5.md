Question: Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language?  Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

Answer: I have used Stata and SAS from my work and from other courses. Comparing to other programming, R is more flexiable and has many packages to use for all kinds of needs and it is free. I don't think I missed other programs. Stata does not require much coding to run models but is not flexiable at all. So far, R is not that difficult to learn. I think the languate is more intuitive than SAS. The first course that I learned about R is ST 501, it was a little bit difficult to understand and know the things running in the background. Thanks to this course, I have a much better understanding of R.
