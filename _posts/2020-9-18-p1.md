Explaining what you did in the project and any findings you made.
+ I created functions to get data from APIs and created a wrapper function to combine these two functions togther. I know nothing about hocky, so I made some silly data explore analysis, such as how many players in each team and their postions. Also, I found out that wins, losses, and ties are highly correlated. 


What would you do differently in approaching the project?
+ I wish I could know the dataset better to run some meaning full anaysis. 

What was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?
+ For me, it was to create a function for modifiers. The API is not clear and I am not sure what will be the best to use the modifer. I am looking forward to know a better way to create the functions. Also, I wish the dataset could document better and at lease I would know what each variable means.

what are your big take-aways for future projects?
+ Don't rush.
+ Domin knowledge is important for statistican.
+ Practice more.
