what would you do differently?  
I don't think I would do things differently. But I am curious to learn if there are better ways to do the project.

what was the most difficult part for you?
The automation part is difficult. I got all kinds of errors.

what are your big take-aways from this project?
The big takeway is to knit with paramters and automate the process. For a large dataset, try a subset to make sure everything run smoothly and then run with the full dataset.
