What do you think being a data scientist is about?  What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

A data scientist should be able to work with a large amount of data and make predictions using the data. 

The major duties for data scientists are to provide insights in areas that requested by clients. A data scientist need to have knowledge in both statistic and computer sciencie field.

Similarities between data scitentists and statisticians are they both need to have a good understanding of statistic and be able to dig into the data to find the answer. Differences are data scientist also need to know programing but do not to need make statistical inferences.

I see myself as a statistican at this point and working towards to be a data scientist.
